First The Chunks needs to be generated with the pdfs
using ingest/preprocess.py and create chunks.json file

this will use sentence transformer model for chunking and then  uses spacy's model en_core_web_lg to get the organization names, which we can filter and stored under tickers on each doc, can be used for matching




a chunks.json file is created, diving the pdfs to chunks and then it has 
the format of 
```json

using the chunks.json file ingest them to qdrant db using ingest.py


once data in ingested we can search the data.

we can filter the data to only show the data which has the ticker we want
the search function uses llm to generate similar keywords and append them to a string and searches with the string to get nearest rests, then we can filter with the ticker for further more filtering, the filter will convert everything to lowercase with no spaces and check so that TATA MOTORS PVT LTD can match TATA MOTORS (tried fuzzy but it adds a lot latency)



TODO:

then the retrived contexts are sent to llm for summary generation

    "summary": {
        "content": "1. Overall Impact on the Company: Tata Advanced Systems (TAS), a subsidiary of Tata Motors, appears to be heavily involved in the defense sector, manifesting in various collaborations, projects, and defense contracts. The company is engaged in the manufacturing of armored vehicles and defense systems, demonstrating a strong presence in the defense and military industry. The sale of certain assets related to its defense business to Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) indicates an operational realignment within the group's defense entities. This strategic decision could potentially streamline its operations and enhance its focus on its core defense-related activities. Importantly, the company's involvement in the force modernization and military upgrades aligns with the global trend towards the modernization of defense equipment and could further strengthen its market position.\n\n2. Key Financial Aspects: Financially, the sale of defense assets to TASL amounted to `234.09 crores, contributing to the company's revenue stream. However, no specific financial details related to its defense contracts or military projects were disclosed. The company's sustained investment and involvement in defense-related projects underscore its commitment to this sector and indicate a significant portion of its revenue and expenditure might be linked to defense-related activities.\n\n3. Future Outlook and Strategic Moves: Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TAS) seems well-positioned for future growth in the defense sector, given its established presence and ongoing projects. The company's focus on autonomous systems and drone technology aligns with the industry's shift towards unmanned vehicles, suggesting potential future growth areas. The company's engagement in the development of advanced defense systems, including the integration of digital technologies, underpins its innovation-driven approach and could provide a competitive edge in the evolving defense landscape.\n\n4. Risks and Opportunities: While the defense sector offers substantial growth opportunities, it is also subject to various risks, including regulatory changes and geopolitical tensions. The company's significant involvement in this sector could expose it to these uncertainties. However, rising global defense budgets and increasing demand for advanced defense systems could present significant opportunities. For investors, the company's strong position in the defense sector, coupled with its innovative capabilities, could offer potential growth prospects. However, they should also consider the inherent risks associated with this sector.",

We generated INR 5,347 million as cash from operations, of which INR 3,351 million were deployed in capex. During FY 2022-23, noteworthy order wins from our new products included orders to supply, EDL (Electronically locking differential) for an Electric SUV and Differential Assembly along with intermediate gears and input shaft for a Class 4 Electric CV. For the long-term investors, I believe these should be seen as more than mere order wins since these demonstrate the Company's ability to customise and build new products to the needs of the customers, providing longevity to the Company's growth potential. We also announced a technology licensing agreement with a UK-based company Equipmake for the manufacture and sale of drive motors, inverters and drive trains in the power range",

    "summary": "The search query topic, which pertains to the steel industry, is significantly relevant to Tata Advanced Systems. The company is heavily involved in the steel and metal production industry, providing a wide range of products including high carbon steel, low carbon steel, alloy steel, and stainless steel. \n\nFinancially, the steel industry plays a crucial role in the company's revenue generation. For instance, the sale of steel products contributed to a significant portion of the company's total income in FY 2022-23. Moreover, the company has reportedly invested heavily in enhancing its production capabilities, which indicates the strategic importance of steel production to the company's overall business model.\n\nLooking ahead, Tata Advanced Systems appears to be focusing on sustainable and efficient production. The company is prioritizing the use of recycled steel and casting copper/aluminium in its production materials, which reached 29% in FY 2022-23. This aligns with global trends towards sustainability and could potentially provide a competitive edge in the market.\n\nHowever, the company also faces potential risks associated with commodity price volatility and supply chain disruptions, which have been highlighted in the documents provided. Fluctuations in steel prices, for example, may impact the company's profitability. Moreover, the company’s reliance on imported raw materials such as steel, copper, and aluminium could expose it to risks associated with changes in global commodity prices and supply chain disruptions.\n\nOverall, the company's involvement in the steel industry presents both opportunities and challenges. Investors may benefit from the company's strategic focus on sustainable production and its robust position in the steel market. However, they should also be mindful of the potential risks associated with commodity price volatility and supply chain disruptions.",

The prices reached a peak of US$160/t in March 2022, driven by concerns over loss of significant supply in the context of geopolitical conflict in Europe. The prices gradually dropped through the year to touch a low of US$79/t in October 2022, owing to weakness in Chinese real estate sector. However, the iron ore prices firmed up in the following months and stabilised around ~US$120-130/t level in March 2023. In India, FY 2023 iron ore production was stable at ~250 million tonnes with 6% increase in domestic steel production. However, iron ore exports fell by ~23% to ~20 million tonnes as Government of India (GoI) increased iron ore export duty in May 2022.
